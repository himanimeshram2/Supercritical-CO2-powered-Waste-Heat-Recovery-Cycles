# Supercritical-CO2-powered-Waste-Heat-Recovery-Cycles
This repository contains resources, models, and documentation focused on Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) cycles powered by supercritical carbon dioxide (sCOâ‚‚). These systems capture waste heat from industrial processes and convert it into useful power, thus enhancing energy efficiency and reducing emissions.
